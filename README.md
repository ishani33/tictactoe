For running the Java Console Application:

1) Run the Console.java file by navigating to /tictactoe/Console.java

2) Here, 'X' depicts the first player which is human and 'O' is the computer.

3) The Tic Tac Toe board takes in the player input by index. This means that to select position (1, 1), the index would be 4 since it is the 5th square but I have used zero based indexing. The positions for input are is shown as follows:


 0 | 1 | 2

 3 | 4 | 5
 
 6 | 7 | 8
